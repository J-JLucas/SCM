## 💾 Download
Head to the **[Releases](../../releases)** page and grab the zip of latest build (only Windows supported Sorry 🙁).

If prompted to install missing C++ libraries, simply accept, the Unreal Engine installer will handle it automatically.

## 🪖 About

**STARCRAFT: MARINE (SCM)** is a retro-style FPS fan project inspired by *DooM/Project Brutality*, *Quake*, and my love for the *StarCraft* universe.  

Built solo in **Unreal Engine 5**, SCM delivers fast-paced action featuring:

- 🧱 **3 action-packed levels**  
- 🔫 **4 unique weapons**
- 💥 **Dynamic damage where headshots matter**  
- 👾 **4 classic Zerg enemies**
- 🎵 **Iconic StarCraft SFX & music**

SCM was developed over the summer of 2023. Special thanks to my friend Hayden for his Blender expertise, without him this project would have never gotten started, and my brother Nick for adding that extra kick to the weapon SFX. Also thank you to my playtesters for taking the time to provide valuable feedback. 

SCM is currently on hiatus, however I may return to it in the future.

**Thanks for checking out my game,**
**Have fun! 🔫🪖**
